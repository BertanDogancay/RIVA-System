# RIVA-System

A complete backend and frontend cross platform application and system. The application side of this system was made with Flutter framework and the web side of it was made with using Blazor and dot-net framework. The system also requires a seperate domain to store user, product, location etc... data. 

## Preface:
Before going any further, this project is not meant to be a real application due to the amout of gpu power it requires and the veraity of sources it needs to be able to work. If you like to explore, test this kind of stuff and have fun while doing it, then this project will be a great start for you. There is a lot of room to improve, you can even give it a UI and use it on your own computer.
